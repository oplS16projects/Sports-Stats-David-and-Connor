# Project Title: Sports stats

### Statement -Connor
Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn? 

### Analysis
Some of the ideas from class that we plan on implementing into our project include recursion and Higher Order procedures such as map/filter/reduce.

We plan on using recursion by recovering the information from a gigantic statistics table and reorganizing them. There is a website with data on certain sports team that we plan on using for the data analysis. Since extracting all of the information at once is somewhat complex, we plan on using recursion to extract small bits at a time until the whole table has been obtained. Later on, we will also be using recursion with implementing the predictions part since those require some sort of statistical analysis.

Higher Order procedures will be used in our project in only the predictions and analysis part. Certain pieces of information such as outlier data can be removed from the list by using filter. As another example, the map function can be used to perform a certain statistical equation on certain categories of information such as winning and losing streaks.

### Data set or other source materials -Connor
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration-Both
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results-Connor
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

First Connor will extract all of the information from the website containing the giant spreadsheet of numbers in certain categories. While this may sound simple, it has actually been rather difficult and will take some extra effort. Then he will reorganize it into specific ways for David to make his statistical analysis on. Once all of the data has been reorganized, David will proceed to do all of the mathematical calculations that will be used to predict future outcomes and results. In addition, he will make comparisons between the teams and how they are all performing relative to each other. Finally, Connor and David will both be making changes to the code along the way simultaneously to debug any errors.

## Schedule-Both
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)-Connor
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)-Connor
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
During our last week in the semester, we will be going through and knocking out all of the smallest bugs within our code that may exist. By then, we should have already dealt with all of the really major defects within our code. All that should be left is to remove discrepancies with edge cases and outliers. Also, we will try to come up with final questions that should be responded to when doing our project presentations in the hallway.

## Group Responsibilities

### David Bui @buidavid16
will write the code during the statistical analysis and predictions part of the project. He will figure out the formulas and provide mathematical analysis on how the extracted information can be used in certain ways. In addition, David will also assist Connor with figuring out any problems with the code on how to extract all of the numbers from the data table for various teams.

### Connor McLaughlin @CJMcLaughlin
will work on...
